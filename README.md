# Scribbler-Note-Taker-App


This is a note taking app that allows the user to post and edit notes that they would like to review for later. There are several js files open for this app to separate the api and html routes to make for easy editing in the future. This app is all backend and uses express 'require' as the dependency call for the code. This app is deployed on Heroku due to the fact that not all the files are static so that it can be executed.
